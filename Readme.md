# UltiSnips C snippets helping to write GObject code

Those snippets use UltiSnips (
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2715 ) so you should install
and configure it first. I use Vundle ( https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim )
to manage vim plugins but it's not mandatory.

The content of this repo should be located in
    ~/.vim/UltiSnips
so you should have something like:
    ~/.vim/UltiSnips/c.snippets
    ~/.vim/UltiSnips/c
